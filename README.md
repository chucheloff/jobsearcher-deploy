# jobsearcher-deploy

Compose stack + helper scripts for the on-demand job-search pipeline. Pulls jobs
from `jobmcp`, gathers company context from `company-mcp`, drafts a per-job
briefing through OpenRouter, emails it via `gmail-mcp` (Resend), and pings
`slack-mcp`. The `job-search` skill drives the flow; `job-search-reply` drains
the yes/no/skip replies.

## Quickstart

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/<you>/jobsearcher-deploy.git
cd jobsearcher-deploy

cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env                              # fill in CHANGEME values

cp openclaw.template.json $HOME/.openclaw/openclaw.json   # one-time
mkdir -p $HOME/.openclaw/workspace/skills $HOME/.openclaw/workspace/scripts
# install helper that maintains the Valkey-backed processed-job set
cp scripts/processed.js  $HOME/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/processed.js

docker compose up -d                      # ~20s warm; ~10s after first boot

bash run-job-search.sh                    # default: dry-run=true, limit=1
MSG="/job-search dry-run=false limit=3" bash run-job-search.sh
MSG="/job-search-reply" bash run-job-search.sh    # process pending replies
```

## Layout

| Path                         | What it is                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `compose.yml`                | All 7 services: valkey, jobmcp, company-mcp, gmail-mcp, slack-mcp, openclaw-gateway, openclaw-cli. |
| `.env.example`               | Every var with placeholders. Real values go in `.env`.             |
| `openclaw.template.json`     | Sanitized openclaw config. Live edits go to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. |
| `run-job-search.sh`          | Streams gateway/MCP/agent logs interleaved while running a skill. Includes a netns preflight that recreates the cli container so `network_mode: service:gateway` doesn't go stale after a gateway recreate. |
| `switch-openrouter-tier.sh`  | Flips `.env` + `openclaw.json` between `free` and `paid` OpenRouter model presets. Backs up both files. |
| `scripts/processed.js`       | Tiny RESP client used by the skills to maintain `jobsearch:processed` (a Valkey set of already-briefed job ids). Persists across days. |
| `jobmcp/`, `company-mcp/`, `gmail-mcp/` | Submodules. The slack-mcp container uses a published image. |

## Per-pipeline expectations

- **OpenRouter paid tier:** the heavy alias resolves to opus-class; budget on the order of $0.05–$0.15 per 3-job pass depending on briefing length. Cheap fallbacks kick in on rate limits.
- **Resend free tier:** only delivers to the account owner. If you change `MAIL_DEFAULT_TO` to anything other than your verified Resend address, the call returns a sandbox-restriction error — that's expected, not a code bug.

## Operational notes

### Boot

After the first container build, openclaw-gateway warms in ~10s. If you ever see it stalling for minutes, look for `.openclaw-runtime-deps.lock` in `~/.openclaw/plugin-runtime-deps/openclaw-*/` and remove it — that lock can confuse the install path when the container's own pid matches the recorded owner pid (same-pid collision after recreates).

### Avoid restarts

`openclaw-cli` joins `openclaw-gateway`'s netns via `network_mode: service:gateway`. When the gateway is recreated (image swap, model change, config push), the cli's netns goes stale silently — DNS and `127.0.0.1:18789` stop working. `run-job-search.sh` handles this by force-recreating the cli on every invocation. If you exec into the cli container outside that script, run `docker compose up -d --force-recreate --no-deps openclaw-cli` first whenever the gateway has restarted.

### Hot reload

Most `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` edits are picked up live (gateway logs `[reload] config change detected`). Model and provider changes trigger an auto-restart at the next idle moment. You generally don't need `docker compose restart`.

## Skill dependencies

The bundled skills assume:

- `~/.openclaw/workspace/MEMORY.md` exists with `TARGET_ROLES`, `GEO_HARD_FILTERS`, `DEAL_BREAKERS`, `COMP`, `SENIORITY`.
- `~/.openclaw/workspace/cv.txt` exists.
- `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/job-search/SKILL.md` and `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/job-search-reply/SKILL.md` are present (commit them in your *workspace* repo, not this deploy repo).
- `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/processed.js` is installed (see Quickstart).

## Switching tiers

```sh
bash switch-openrouter-tier.sh free       # flip both .env and openclaw.json
bash switch-openrouter-tier.sh paid       # back to anthropic models
```

The script backs up both files (`*.bak-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`) before mutating.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| ------- | ------------ | --- |
| Agent says "command not found" for `jobmcp.*` (with a dot) | Outdated MEMORY.md | Use `jobmcp__*` (double-underscore) everywhere. |
| `jobmcp.search_jobs` itself returns "not found" | Tool not in `tools.alsoAllow` | Either add it or switch `tools.profile` from `minimal` to `messaging`. |
| `openclaw agent ... → connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:18789` | cli netns stale after gateway recreate | `run-job-search.sh` handles automatically; otherwise `docker compose up -d --force-recreate --no-deps openclaw-cli`. |
| `OpenRouter pricing fetch failed (timeout 60s)` | Cosmetic — cli pulls model pricing on boot | Ignore unless other OpenRouter calls also fail. |
| Slack post fails with `not_in_channel` | Bot not added to the channel | In Slack: `/invite @JobSearcherBot` in the target channel. |
